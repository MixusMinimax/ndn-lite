// Basic Design:
// 1. The access control policy are decided by schema
// 2. The access control key can be roll overed by existing key (e.g., through one-way function)
// 3. The access control granularity can be kept in the service type level at the moment

// void
// ac_after_bootstrapping(ndn_face_intf_t* face); // which is to load oneâ€™s own produced data prefixes into the state
